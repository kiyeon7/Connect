How to compile the project:
1)	Copy all the files into your CS50 IDE
2)	In terminal window, type “cd/implementation” and then “Flask Run”
3)	In the terminal window, click the link that shows (e.g. http://ide50-kiyeonlee.cs50.io:8080/)
4)	Enter a dining hall (such as Annenberg) and find a table to sit at. On the website, check-in by entering your name, time (that you want your entry to expire), location (in the dining hall or your identifying features), and (conversation) interests. For example, name = Joe Smith; time leaving = 08:00 PM; location= Table A5; interests= CS50, music, finance. Other people entering the dining hall can also type in their own information.
5)	After pressing submit, you should see your entry below the form. On their devices (including laptop, tablet, and mobile), other users will be able to scroll through the list of available students and see your information. If people are interested in joining you at your table, they will also check-in by entering their information and the same location that you’ve entered.
6)	If you’ve mistyped any information, you can edit your entry by pressing the edit button on the right of your row. Press submit when done editing.
7)	If you’d like to delete your entry (perhaps you’re leaving earlier), then press the delete button next to the edit button. Your entry will disappear from the list.
8)	Engage in deep life conversations and make new friends.
